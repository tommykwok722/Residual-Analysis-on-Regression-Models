# Residual Analysis on Regression Models
A MATLAB program related to Regression Models.

## Background
Regression analysis is a statistical method for examining the relationships between a dependent variable and 
independent variables.

## Objectives
Since it is not possible to find out the exact model which explains the relationships between 
a dependent variable and independent variables, I would like to simulate several regression models and 
find out the better model based on **residual analysis** and **influence diagnostics**.

## Definitions
**Definition of residual:** Residual is the vertical distance between the value on the true regression model 
(unknown) and the fitted value on the regression line.

To study the residuals, we have to check whether the residuals match the following assumptions:
1. Constant (Zero) mean
2. Constant variance

**Definition of influence diagnostics:** Influence diagnostics are the measures to determine if an observation is an 
influential point, leverage point or outlier.

1. Leverage
2. Cookâ€™s Distance
3. Difference in Fitted Values (DFFITS)
4. Studentized Residuals

## Idea and Setup
`fishdata.txt` contains the data of fish based on its length, height, width, species and weight.
1. **Length:** Length of a fish (cm) <br>
2. **Height:** Height of a fish (cm) <br>
3. **Width:** Width of a fish (cm) <br>
4. **Species:** Species of a fish (from 1 to 6) <br>
5. **Weight:** Weight of a fish (gram) <br>

According to my program, I extract a total of 201 observations (665th-865th) from the data `fishdata.txt`,
then simulate 3 different regression models and perform residual analysis.
The regression models are based on the following dependent and independent variables:
- Dependent (Response) variable: `Weight`
- Independent (Explanatory) variables: `Length`, `Height`, `Width`, `Species`
